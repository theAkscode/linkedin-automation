# LinkedIn Automation

A sophisticated Go application for automating LinkedIn login and interactions with human-like behavior simulation using the Rod browser automation library.

## Overview

This project uses [Rod](https://go-rod.github.io/) to automate browser interactions with LinkedIn. It features advanced stealth techniques including random mouse movements, natural scrolling patterns, and realistic typing speeds to avoid detection by anti-bot systems.

## Features

- **Automated LinkedIn Login** - Logs into LinkedIn with email/password credentials
- **Human-like Behavior Simulation**:
  - Random mouse movements (3-5 movements with natural pauses)
  - Random page scrolling (3-5 scrolls with reading time)
  - Realistic typing speeds
  - Random delays between actions (simulating human reaction time)
- **Stealth Fingerprint Masking** - Masks automation indicators to avoid detection
- **Comprehensive Logging** - Detailed logs of all actions performed
- **Browser Automation** - Full control over browser interactions using Rod library
- **Environment-based Credentials** - Secure credential management via .env file

## Prerequisites

- **Go 1.24.5** or higher
- **Chrome/Chromium browser** (Rod will auto-download if not present)
- **Windows Defender exclusion** (optional, see troubleshooting)
- **.env file** with LinkedIn credentials

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/linkedin-automation.git
cd linkedin-automation
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
go mod tidy
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
LINKEDIN_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
LINKEDIN_PASSWORD=your_password
```

4. Build the project (optional):
```bash
go build
```

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites Check
```bash
# Verify Go is installed
go version  # Should be 1.24.5 or higher

# Verify you're in the project directory
cd linkedin-automation
ls -la  # Should show main.go, README.md, go.mod, etc.
```

### Setup Steps
```bash
# Step 1: Download dependencies
go mod tidy

# Step 2: Create credentials file (.env)
# On Windows (PowerShell):
@"
LINKEDIN_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
LINKEDIN_PASSWORD=your_password
"@ | Out-File -Encoding UTF8 .env

# On Linux/Mac:
cat > .env << EOF
LINKEDIN_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
LINKEDIN_PASSWORD=your_password
EOF

# Step 3: Verify .env file exists
ls -la .env  # Should show .env file

# Step 4: Run the application
go run main.go
```

### What to Expect (Timeline)
- **0-2 seconds**: "Starting LinkedIn Automation" log appears
- **2-3 seconds**: Browser window launches (Chrome opens)
- **3-5 seconds**: Navigates to LinkedIn login page
- **5-15 seconds**: Enters credentials and logs in (watch it type)
- **15-20 seconds**: "Login Successful" message appears
- **20-25 seconds**: Mouse movements visible on page (cursor moving)
- **25-30 seconds**: Page scrolls up and down automatically
- **30+ seconds**: Browser stays open showing home page

## Usage

Run the application:
```bash
go run main.go
```

### What the Application Does

1. **Loads credentials** from the `.env` file
2. **Launches a Chrome browser** in non-headless mode (visible)
3. **Navigates to LinkedIn login page**
4. **Performs automated login** with human-like delays
5. **Verifies successful login** by checking page URL
6. **Applies fingerprint masking** to avoid detection
7. **Simulates human behavior**:
   - Random mouse movements across the page
   - Random scrolling with natural pauses
   - Realistic timing between all actions
8. **Keeps browser open** for 30+ seconds showing the results

### Expected Output

```

## Verification Steps (Testing Actual Functionality)

### Step 1: Verify Compilation
```bash
go build
# Should complete with no errors
ls -la linkedin-automation.exe  # File should exist
```

### Step 2: Run and Verify Each Feature

**A. Verify Credential Loading**
```bash
go run main.go
# Check logs for: "Starting LinkedIn Automation"
# Check that browser launches
```

**B. Verify LinkedIn Login**
- Watch the browser window
- See email field being filled automatically
- See password field being filled automatically
- See the "Sign in" button being clicked
- Wait for page to load and check logs for "Login Successful"

**C. Verify Mouse Movements** ✅
- After login, watch the **mouse cursor** on the page
- You should see the cursor move to **3-5 different positions**
- Each movement is followed by a **300-800ms pause**
- Check logs for: "Executing random mouse movements..."

**D. Verify Page Scrolling** ✅
- After mouse movements, watch the **page scroll**
- Page should scroll down **3-5 times**
- Each scroll is 200-600 pixels
- Followed by 800-1500ms pause (reading time)
- Check logs for: "Executing random page scrolling..."

**E. Verify Logging**
- Check that **every action is logged**
- Look for log format: `[TIMESTAMP] INFO: Action name`
- Verify no ERROR messages in logs

### Step 3: Test with Different Credentials
```bash
# Edit .env with test account
# Run again
go run main.go

# Verify it works with different credentials
```

### Step 4: Test Build Executable
```bash
# Build the project
go build

# Run the executable instead of 'go run'
./linkedin-automation.exe

# Should work identically to 'go run main.go'
```

### Success Indicators ✅

## Configuration

### .env File Requirements

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your LinkedIn credentials:
```env
LINKEDIN_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
LINKEDIN_PASSWORD=your_password
```

⚠️ **Security Warning**: Never commit `.env` files to version control. Add it to `.gitignore`.

### Browser Settings

Edit [internal/browser/browser.go](internal/browser/browser.go) to customize:

- **Headless mode**: Change `Headless(false)` to `Headless(true)` for invisible browsing
- **Browser binary**: Set custom Chrome path with `.Bin("/path/to/chrome")`
- **Additional flags**: Add launcher flags as needed

### Stealth Settings

Customize behavior simulation in:
- [internal/stealth/delay.go](internal/stealth/delay.go) - Adjust delay ranges
- [internal/stealth/mouse.go](internal/stealth/mouse.go) - Adjust movement ranges (lines 7-8)
- [internal/stealth/scroll.go](internal/stealth/scroll.go) - Adjust scroll ranges (lines 7-8)
- [internal/stealth/typing.go](internal/stealth/typing.go) - Typing speed parameters

## How Stealth Works

### Mouse Movement Simulation
- Performs 3-5 random mouse movements
- Coordinates range: X(100-800px), Y(100-600px)
- Pause between movements: 300-800ms
- Avoids corners to appear natural

### Scrolling Simulation
- Performs 3-5 random scroll actions
- Scroll distance per action: 200-600 pixels
- Pause between scrolls: 800-1500ms
- Mimics human reading behavior

### Typing Simulation
- Realistic keystroke delays between characters
- Variable speed based on character type
- Occasional typos and corrections (optional)

### Timing & Delays
- Login field detection: 800-1500ms delay
- Form submission: 1000-2000ms delay
- Page load verification: 3000-5000ms delay
- All delays are randomized to appear natural

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. ".env file not found" error

**Problem**: Application exits with error about missing `.env` file

**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify .env exists in project root
ls -la .env

# If missing, create it
echo "LINKEDIN_EMAIL=your_email@example.com" > .env
echo "LINKEDIN_PASSWORD=your_password" >> .env

# Verify contents
cat .env
```

#### 2. "go: command not found"

**Problem**: Go is not installed or not in PATH

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if Go is installed
go version

# If not, download from https://golang.org/dl/
# Add Go to your PATH environment variable
# Restart PowerShell/Terminal after installation
```

#### 3. "Failed to start Browser" error

**Problem**: Chrome/Chromium not installed

**Solution**:
```bash
# Option 1: Let Rod download Chrome automatically
# The first run will download a Chromium instance

# Option 2: Install Chrome manually
# Download from https://www.google.com/chrome/

# Option 3: Set custom Chrome path in browser.go
.Bin("C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe")
```

#### 4. Windows Defender Blocking Rod

**Problem**: "Operation did not complete successfully because the file contains a virus or potentially unwanted software"

**Solution**:
```powershell
# Add exclusion to Windows Defender
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "$env:TEMP\leakless-*" -Force

# Or manually:
# 1. Open Windows Security
# 2. Go to Virus & threat protection → Virus & threat protection settings
# 3. Click "Manage settings" under "Virus & threat protection settings"
# 4. Scroll down to "Exclusions"
# 5. Click "Add exclusions"
# 6. Select "Folder" and add: C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Temp\leakless-*
```

#### 5. "Login Failed: email input not found"

**Problem**: Email input field selector is not found

**Solution**:
```bash
# LinkedIn HTML may have changed
# Edit internal/automation/login.go and update the selector
emailInput, err := page.Element(`input#username`)

# To find the correct selector:
# 1. Open LinkedIn login page in Chrome
# 2. Right-click on email field → Inspect
# 3. Find the correct ID or class name
# 4. Update the selector in login.go
```

#### 6. No Mouse Movements or Scrolling Visible

**Problem**: Application runs but mouse movements and scrolling not visible

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check 1: Browser must be visible (non-headless)
# In browser.go, ensure:
Headless(false)  # NOT true

# Check 2: Verify stealth actions are being called
# Check logs for "Executing random mouse movements..."
# If missing, check main.go has this line:
browser.PerformStealthActions(page)

# Check 3: Increase delay times in stealth files
# Edit internal/stealth/mouse.go and increase:
time.Sleep(time.Duration(1000+r.Intn(1000)) * time.Millisecond)

# Check 4: Verify page is fully loaded
# Wait longer before performing stealth actions
stealth.RandomDelay(3000, 5000)  // 3-5 second wait
```

#### 7. "Login verification timeout"

**Problem**: Application takes too long to verify login

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check internet connection - LinkedIn may be slow
# Increase timeout in internal/automation/login.go:
timeout := time.After(60 * time.Second)  // Increase to 60 seconds

# Check if LinkedIn is accessible
# Try opening LinkedIn in regular Chrome browser
```

#### 8. "Module not found" error

**Problem**: `linkedin-automation/internal/...` module not found

**Solution**:
```bash
# Ensure you're in the correct directory
pwd  # Should end with linkedin-automation

# Reinstall dependencies
go mod tidy
go mod download

# Verify go.mod exists
ls -la go.mod
```

#### 9. "Port 9222 already in use"

**Problem**: Another instance of the application is running

**Solution**:
```bash
# On Windows (PowerShell):
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -like "*chrome*"} | Stop-Process

# On Linux/Mac:
pkill chrome

# Or just restart your terminal/PowerShell
```

#### 10. Application runs but immediately exits

**Problem**: No error message but program closes immediately

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check that .env file has valid credentials
cat .env

# Check that credentials are correct
# Try logging in manually to verify they work

# Check for silent errors:
go run main.go 2>&1 | tee output.log
# This saves all output to output.log for review
```

### Windows Defender Blocking Rod

If you see: `Operation did not complete successfully because the file contains a virus or potentially unwanted software`

Add an exclusion to Windows Defender:
```powershell
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "$env:TEMP\leakless-*" -Force
```

Or manually:
1. Open Windows Security
2. Go to Virus & threat protection settings
3. Add exclusion for `%TEMP%\leakless-*`

### Browser Not Opening

- Ensure Chrome/Chromium is installed or let Rod download it
- Check that `Headless(false)` is set in browser.go
- Verify no firewall is blocking the browser process

### Login Fails

- Verify credentials in `.env` file are correct
- Check that LinkedIn is accessible from your network
- Ensure the LinkedIn login page HTML selectors haven't changed
- Check console logs for specific error messages

### No Mouse Movements or Scrolling Visible

- Ensure `Headless(false)` is set (browser must be visible)
- Check that `PerformStealthActions(page)` is being called in main.go
- Verify logger output shows stealth action messages
- Increase pause durations in stealth files if movements are too fast to see

## Dependencies

- `github.com/go-rod/rod` - Browser automation library
- `github.com/joho/godotenv` - .env file loading
- `github.com/ysmood/leakless` - Process management (included with rod)

See [go.mod](go.mod) for complete dependencies.

## Development

### Running with Debug Output

Add logging to see detailed execution:
```go
logger.Info("Your debug message")
```

### Adding New Features

1. Create new modules in the `internal/` directory
2. Follow the existing logging patterns
3. Use stealth functions to maintain natural behavior
4. Test thoroughly before deployment

### Extending Stealth Techniques

Add new stealth methods in `internal/stealth/`:
```go
// Example: New stealth function
func RandomHover(page *rod.Page) {
    // Implementation
}
```

Then call from `browser.PerformStealthActions()`.

## Important Notes

⚠️ **LinkedIn's Terms of Service**: Ensure your automation complies with LinkedIn's ToS. Unauthorized automation may result in account suspension.

✅ **Best Practices**:
- Use delays between actions
- Don't perform bulk operations rapidly
- Respect rate limits
- Log all activities for compliance
- Test with a dedicated account first
